DSM,"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a handbook used by healthcare professionals to diagnose mental health conditions",Psychology,"The DSM has had some criticisms over the years."
Comorbidity,"The occurrence of two or more disorders in the same person at the same time, at rates higher than would happen by chance",Psychology,"The kinds of things that have been spoken about for quite a while now are things like comorbidity, right?"
Symptom overlap,"When the same symptoms appear in multiple different disorder diagnoses",Psychology,"There's things like symptom overlap."
Heterogeneity,"Variation in how symptoms present among different people who have the same diagnosis",Psychology,"The third one might be heterogeneity in the diagnosis."
Diagnostic criteria,"The specific list of symptoms and requirements needed to assign a particular mental health diagnosis",Psychology,"You have to have five to meet full diagnostic criteria."
Major depressive disorder,"A mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and other symptoms that impair daily functioning",Psychology,"So major depressive disorder, for example, has nine diagnostic criteria."
Checklist approach,"A method of diagnosis where clinicians check off symptoms from a list to determine if a person meets criteria for a disorder",Psychology,"And that can happen because of the checklist approach in the DSM."
Categorical threshold,"A cutoff point where having a certain number of symptoms means you have a diagnosis, and having fewer means you don't",Psychology,"And because of the categorical threshold that once you reach a certain number of symptoms, you have a diagnosis."
Reliability,"The consistency with which mental health professionals assign the same diagnosis to the same person or case",Psychology,"And then another key one is the low reliability of the diagnosis."
Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology,"A dimensional model for classifying mental disorders that organizes symptoms in a hierarchy rather than as distinct categories",Psychology,"Together, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the traditional models and compare them with the hierarchical taxonomy of Psychopathology Model."
Quantitative psychologist,"A psychologist who uses statistical methods and mathematical models to analyze patterns in psychological data",Psychology,"I would say I'm a quantitative psychologist, so I really rely on using statistics to find patterns in data."
Psychopathology,"The scientific study of mental disorders, including their symptoms, causes, and treatments",Psychology,"In this episode of Under the Cortex, APS welcomes Miri Forbes from Macquarie University, who recently published an article in Clinical Psychological Science, Exploring the Symptom-Level Structure of Psychopathology in Youth."
HiTOP framework,"The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, an empirically-based classification system that organizes mental health symptoms into dimensional spectra rather than categorical diagnoses",Psychology,"There is also this thing that we call the HiTOP framework."
Empirically-based classification system,"A diagnostic system that is derived from patterns observed in actual data rather than from committee consensus or theoretical models",Psychology,"And basically, instead of taking a committee consensus-based approach to deriving and organizing diagnosis, it's based on following the patterns in data."
Dimensional,"In mental health classification, the concept that psychological traits and symptoms exist on a continuum where everyone falls somewhere on the spectrum, rather than as distinct categories you either have or don't have",Psychology,"And so the data supports the idea that most domains of psychopathology are dimensional, not categorical."
Spectra,"In the HiTOP framework, broad domains or dimensions of psychopathology where people can be placed along a continuum",Psychology,"So there's maybe, I would say, six core spectra in the middle that are a lot like the big five of personality, where Everyone sits somewhere on every dimension."
Big five of personality,"A widely-used model in psychology that describes personality using five main dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism",Psychology,"So there's maybe, I would say, six core spectra in the middle that are a lot like the big five of personality, where Everyone sits somewhere on every dimension."
Units of analysis,"The basic building blocks or fundamental elements being studied or measured in research",Psychology,"And that's ironic because the whole premise of high top is that we need to move beyond those constructs as our units of analysis or as the constructs that frame our research."
Self-report measures,"Assessment tools where individuals answer questions about their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors",Psychology,"But all of them are subscales from existing self-report measures."
Missing at random,"A statistical concept where missing data occurs in a way that is unrelated to the values of the missing data itself, allowing for valid statistical analysis",Psychology,"So like as randomized as you can get, which allowed us to build this massively missing at random design so that if people didn't complete all of the items, some of them because they selected a shorter survey length from the outset and some of them because they gave up because there were too many questions, then we can still use their data because the questions that they answered are not related to which survey they selected or whether they dropped out."
Analytic sample,"The subset of research participants whose data is actually used in the statistical analysis",Psychology,"So In total, we had about 15,000 people in the analytic sample."
Internalizing,"A category of mental health symptoms characterized by directing distress inward, including anxiety, depression, and negative emotions",Psychology,"So we saw familiar constructs like internalizing, which is a propensity for negative affect or distress, externalizing, which is more like behaviorally disinhibited things and antagonism, thought disorder, which is schizophrenia spectrum psychosis kinds of symptoms, somataform, which is those physical symptoms that people experience."
Externalizing,"A category of mental health symptoms characterized by directing distress outward through impulsive or disruptive behaviors",Psychology,"So we saw familiar constructs like internalizing, which is a propensity for negative affect or distress, externalizing, which is more like behaviorally disinhibited things and antagonism, thought disorder, which is schizophrenia spectrum psychosis kinds of symptoms, somataform, which is those physical symptoms that people experience."
Thought disorder,"A category of mental health symptoms involving disruptions in thinking patterns, commonly seen in schizophrenia and psychotic conditions",Psychology,"So we saw familiar constructs like internalizing, which is a propensity for negative affect or distress, externalizing, which is more like behaviorally disinhibited things and antagonism, thought disorder, which is schizophrenia spectrum psychosis kinds of symptoms, somataform, which is those physical symptoms that people experience."
Somatoform,"Mental health conditions where people experience physical symptoms that have psychological rather than medical causes",Psychology,"So we saw familiar constructs like internalizing, which is a propensity for negative affect or distress, externalizing, which is more like behaviorally disinhibited things and antagonism, thought disorder, which is schizophrenia spectrum psychosis kinds of symptoms, somataform, which is those physical symptoms that people experience."
Detachment,"In psychopathology, a pattern of withdrawal from social relationships and restricted emotional expression",Psychology,"So we saw mania and detachment went together in mania and low detachment, excuse me, went together into something that looked a bit like extraversion in the literature."
Eating pathology,"Disordered patterns of eating behavior and attitudes toward food, weight, and body image",Psychology,"And similarly, eating pathology is part of internalizing in high top, but was separate here."
Neurodevelopmental,"Related to the growth and development of the brain and nervous system, often referring to conditions that emerge during childhood development",Psychology,"And then a really key difference at this broad level of the organizing constructs was that there was a whole new branch of neurodevelopmental and cognitive difficulties, which isn't something that's represented in high top at the moment."
Subfactors,"In statistical modeling, smaller components or subdivisions within a larger factor or dimension",Psychology,"And so there's a lot more detail in the model that we have a lot more subfactors, a lot of clusters, like highly, highly correlated syndromes thing, how symptoms hang together."
Syndromes,"Groups of symptoms that tend to occur together and characterize a particular condition or disorder",Psychology,"And so there's a lot more detail in the model that we have a lot more subfactors, a lot of clusters, like highly, highly correlated syndromes thing, how symptoms hang together."
Schizophrenia,"A serious mental disorder characterized by disruptions in thinking, perception, emotions, and behavior, including hallucinations and delusions",Psychology,"In your paper, you note that some of the greatest differences between your analysis and the DSM-defined cost-reacts were in the diagnosis with the deepest historical roots, like schizophrenia."
Covarying,"In statistics, when two or more variables tend to change together in a predictable pattern",Psychology,"The way that the symptoms are organized in the DSM isn't the way that we see the symptoms are covarying in how people report experiencing them."
ADHD,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity",Psychology,"That's where ADHD came from."
Psychodynamic theory,"A psychological framework based on the idea that unconscious mental processes influence behavior and emotions, originating from Freud's work",Psychology,"We've got the roles of psychodynamic theory and lobbyists, right?"
Insomnia disorder,"A sleep disorder characterized by persistent difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting quality sleep despite having the opportunity",Psychology,"There were a couple of examples of really tightly bound disorders, like insomnia disorder, where all of the symptoms were in a tightly bound syndrome."
Intermittent explosive disorder,"A mental health condition characterized by sudden episodes of impulsive, aggressive, or violent behavior that are out of proportion to the situation",Psychology,"So for example, things like intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, those kinds of behavioral dysregulation disorders."
Conduct disorder,"A childhood behavioral disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of violating social norms and the rights of others",Psychology,"So for example, things like intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, those kinds of behavioral dysregulation disorders."
Behavioral dysregulation,"Difficulty controlling or managing behavioral responses, often resulting in impulsive or inappropriate actions",Psychology,"So for example, things like intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, those kinds of behavioral dysregulation disorders."
Sexual dysfunctions,"Problems that prevent a person from experiencing satisfaction during sexual activity, such as low desire, arousal difficulties, or pain",Psychology,"Similarly, we saw symptoms of sexual dysfunctions, some of the eating disorders, some of the anxiety disorders."
Empirically coherent,"In research, when findings or constructs are logically consistent and supported by observable data",Psychology,"So they were pretty empirically coherent."
Co-variation,"The degree to which two or more variables change together in a correlated way",Psychology,"And so the symptoms split apart based on those patterns of co-variation in how people reported experiencing the symptoms in our sample."
Neural substrates,"The underlying brain structures, circuits, or biological mechanisms that support specific mental functions or behaviors",Psychology,"Which ones of these are aligning more reliably with specific neural substrates?"
Team science,"A collaborative approach to research where scientists from different disciplines and institutions work together on shared scientific problems",Psychology,"That's my very optimistic take, is that It's about team science."
Open science,"A movement in research that promotes transparency, data sharing, and public accessibility of scientific methods and findings",Psychology,"It's about shared resources, open science and data, those sorts of things, I think, will help us move in this direction of tackling what is a really big problem for the field."
